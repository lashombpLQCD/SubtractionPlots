# SubtractionPlots

Utilities for plotting the subtraction results from the qqcd program data from FORTRAN and MATLAB. 

### File Description 
- `log10mean.m`: Computes the base 10 logged average of a set of variances
- `log_rel_var_cal.m`: Computes the log-averaged relative variance
- `reexpo.m`: Computes re-exponentiated relative variance and error bars for plotting
- `stderr_jack.m`: Uses the jackknife to obtain standard error (error bars) for the base-10 log of the log-averaged relative variance.
